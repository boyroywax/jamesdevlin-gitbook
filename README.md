Hi there! My name is James Devlin. I’m passionate about sustainability, open source software, and decentralized systems. I have excellent written and verbal communication skills and am able to switch seamlessly between writing internal technical documentation and customer-facing how-to’s and guides. I’m experienced in using project management systems such as Jira and Trello.

In terms of technical skills, I have experience with a wide range of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, C#, Solidity, and Rust. I’m a quick learner and am always eager to pick up new concepts and toolsets.

I also have experience working in startups. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am able to work both independently and as part of a focused group. I’m adaptable, resourceful, and always ready to take on new challenges.

I believe that sustainability, open source software, and decentralized systems have the power to change the world for the better. I’m excited to continue learning and growing in these fields.
